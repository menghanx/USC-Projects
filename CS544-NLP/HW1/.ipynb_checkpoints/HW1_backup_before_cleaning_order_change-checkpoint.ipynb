      "simple. this is the best mechanical corkscrew/wine opener on the market. it's quick, it's easy, and it's consistent. this product made me seriously reconsider my method of removing the foil covering the cork... when that becomes the most time consuming part of opening a bottle of wine it's a victory for the corkscrew! it even takes me longer to pull it out of the drawer than to remove the cork. it took a few practice bottles (yummmmmm) to get the \\\\\"touch\\\\\" but after that it became as easy to open a bottle of wine as putting a hot knife through butter. it's not hard to get the \\\\\"touch\\\\\", just stabilize, firm constant squeeze, and steady down/up on the lever. warning*** be careful lending this to your neighbor or letting other use it even in your own home without a demonstration on the first bottle of wine... if there is only one bottle of wine what the heck are you doing letting someone else open it at your house!?!?!  seriously though this thing is amazing if you have the \\\\\"touch\\\\\" (aka know how to use it) but can really piss you off and lead you to try and force things and/or break it if you do not have the touch.\n"
