Note:
	pre-processing, I was not able to install contraction or pycontraction using pip, so had to create a json as dictionary for contraction.

Three sample reviews in raw format:
	1. Very Nice!!  Exactly as described!!!!!
	2. Easy to use.  Ice cream in 20 minutes, couldn't be better.
	3. Even though this product works great, the edge can break or crack easily. The edge is where the glass doubles back to create the space between the two walls. When you have any liquids in the cup, all that weight is being cantilevered from the outer wall to the inner wall, i.e. suspended. So, if you happen to bump or shake the cup while it is full, that puts a lot of stress on that edge. I've had 1 cup chip. I also bought the water jug but that one just broke when I bumped it against the sink after filling it. Yea, the worst possible scenario. So, if you are willing to pay for the great looks and functionality buy this but do expect that they won't last as other cups that cost less.<br /><br />The double wall really does insulate the contents, hot or cold. So, your contents last longer and your hand does not get hot or cold. Great for ice cream and tea. Their tea pot is also very good. I haven't broken that one......yet.
