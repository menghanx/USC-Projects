The average percent overlap between Ask results and Google results is 32% and the average Spearman coefficient is -6.14. Just based on the comparison of above stats and number of results actually returned from each engine, I think Ask is worse than google, because in some cases, Ask returns less results compare to google. However, without knowing how relavent each result is from each engine, I cannot really say which is actually better at returning more relavent results.
